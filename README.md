 Algorithm Pseudocode

1. Initialization:
2.      Xp := Vp
3. Round r:
4.      Srp:
5.		   send <Xp> to all processes
6.      Trp:
7.         if | HO (p,r)| > 2n / 3 then
8.            Xp := the smallest most often received value
9.            if more than 2n/3 values received are equal to bar<x> then
10.                DECIDE(bar<x>) 			  




TODOs:
	Realize every line from the presudocode.
	Write code on verify.pml
